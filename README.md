## üîç Overview

The **Linora Cipher** is a symmetric encryption algorithm developed by `modify` in 2025. It transforms characters using modular arithmetic and chained differences, making each output character reliant on both the input and the previous result.

## üîê Algorithm Description

### Step 1: Character Conversion

- Convert all characters to numbers:  
  `a = 0, b = 1, ..., z = 25`

### Step 2: Encryption

1. **First character**:  
   Add the first key element to it, modulo 26.

2. **Each subsequent character**:
   - Compute the difference from the previous **plaintext** character (mod 26).
   - Multiply the result by the corresponding key element (cycled).
   - Take the result modulo 26.

### Step 3: Decryption

1. **First character**:  
   Subtract the first key element from it (modulo 26).

2. **Subsequent characters**:
   - Multiply the ciphered character by the modular inverse of the corresponding key element (mod 26).
   - Add the result to the previous **plaintext** character, modulo 26.

## üìò Example

- **Plaintext**: `hello`  
- **Key**: `[3, 5, 7]`  
- Each character is transformed step-by-step using the above algorithm.
- The cipher chaining ensures that a small change in input cascades through the rest of the output.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notes

The Linora Cipher introduces chaining similar to Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode in block ciphers, but operates at the character level.

- Not intended for industrial cryptographic security.
- Suitable for obfuscation, experimentation, games, puzzles, and learning.
- Resistant to simple frequency analysis due to chaining.
